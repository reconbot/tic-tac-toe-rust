# things to learn / do

- add a link to question mark notation in the enum section of "the book"
- What is question mark notation? I found it! https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html#a-shortcut-for-propagating-errors-the--operator
- link to "HashMap<K, V>" in standard library in https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch08-03-hash-maps.html
- add a non complex `collect` example in hash docs
- What the hell is "_" as a type?
- Figure out why `let timber_resources: HashMap<&str, i32> = [("Norway", 100), ("Denmark", 50), ("Iceland", 10)]
    .iter().cloned().collect();` needs a clone
